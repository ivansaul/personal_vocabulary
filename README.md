# Flutter Template

This template utilizes the `device_preview` package for Flutter to streamline the development and fine-tuning of application layouts across different devices and screen sizes.

The `device_preview` package offers a convenient way to preview and emulate the appearance of your application in real-time on various devices and orientations. You can adjust screen sizes, change orientations, and simulate device events to test and optimize the user interface of your application.
